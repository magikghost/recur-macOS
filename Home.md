- [r_e_c_u_r : in-depth demo]
- [_conjur_ - playing shaders with r_e_c_u_r]
- [_captur_ - processing live video with r_ e_c_u_r]
- [_detour_ - frame-sampling with r_ e_c_u_r]

also you might be interested in: 

- the [faq]
- always the links to the [latest img]
- list of [parts and sources] others have used with r_e_c_u_r
