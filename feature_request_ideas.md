# feature request ideas

at the moment lots of feature requests get posted on the facebook group, or written to me directly. this is ok and i love discussing these things but i think also we need a central place to organize these ideas, and maybe some way people can express which they are most interested in.

i think the github issues section works quite well for this, but also it can get a bit messy and confusing with all the bugs etc.

i will try atleast list the ideas that are in my head at the moment here...


## support pi4
## osc input + pi as wifi transmitter
## gpio matrix input
## touch screen as shader params
## camera settings - exposure, shutter, resolution, ratio etc for openframeworks backend
## copying files to and from external device
## support videos audio track - bonus record audio in??
## saving shader param settings per slot
## support NDI ; waiting for offical pi support here
## player types to detour such as pingpong
## option to record output rather than input
## support images / gifs in the sampler mode
## a bank mode similar to sampler / shdr_bnk but for triggering generic system actions - mapping python files?
## playing a video from the browser - similar to how you can play shaders from shader browser
## file list should be alphabetical
## page up / page down nav shortcuts
## improve some of the mix shaders
## design laser-cut enclosure
## usb eject setting
## cue mode - different output on display to screen - not sure if this is possible ?
## optimize analog read / midi performance to update atlease once per frame with minimal stepping
## ??? some kindof projection mapping option ???
